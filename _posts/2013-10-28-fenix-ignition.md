## FenixEdu™ Ignition First Edition

We have the pleasure to announce that we are hosting the first edition of FenixEdu™ Ignition, an hackaton event where we will launch a new service to both user and developer communities.

In this event, we will take the application development to a complete whole new level. Through a REST API, FenixEdu™ users will now be able to develop and/or authorize third-party applications that can access their protected academic resources.

FenixEdu™ Ignition has its own [website][Ignition] where users can enroll, form teams, submit their ideas, win badges and read the latest news about the event. The event website is proudly using the REST API.

Everyone in the Técnico Lisboa community is invited to attend and participate in the event. However, only students can apply their projects to the competition and win the respective prizes.
