## FenixEdu Does Not Work Without Hackers

Every project needs creative people that look at technology and reinvent it to create new applications.

We presented a pre-release of the FenixEdu Rest API at the <a href="http://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">HackerSchool</a> event specifically oriented for the development of mobile applications.
