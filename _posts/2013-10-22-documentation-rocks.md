## Documentation Rocks!

As you might noticed, we dropped the excuse of saying that the best documentation is the code itself.

The FenixEdu™ project now has an *always-in-progress* documentation that can stand up to the level of the project's renewed image.

FenixEdu™ project now has documentation oriented to the developer, explaining our development methodology, our technologies, and all our sub-projects.

The documentation serves two purposes:
1. Newcomers get started more quickly.
2. Members allocated to other projects can adapt more quickly to existing projects.
3. Outsiders can provide contributions more easily.
4. Interested outside developers can better understand the project and adapt it to their needs.
