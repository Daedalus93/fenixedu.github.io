### Overview

[Técnico Lisboa][Técnico Lisboa] is Portugals most prestigious school of
engineering. [DSI][DSI] is the schools computer and network services. We have
been developing open source software, mainly directed at solving problems for
higher education institutions, since 2001. Every institution involved in higher
education is different and has its own needs and processes. However, this is
not incompatible with different institutions sharing ideas, resources and
solutions. Hoping our solutions may be useful to others, we share our software
with the community whenever possible. We develop a wide range of solutions,
from academic and administrative processes to general purpose software
libraries.
