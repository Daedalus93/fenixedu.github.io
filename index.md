### Overview

[Técnico Lisboa][Técnico Lisboa] is Portugals most prestigious school of
engineering. [DSI][DSI] is the schools computer and network services. We have
been developing open source software, mainly directed at solving problems for
higher education institutions, since 2001. Every institution involved in higher
education is different and has its own needs and processes. However, this is
not incompatible with different institutions sharing ideas, resources and
solutions. Hoping our solutions may be useful to others, we share our software
with the community whenever possible. We develop a wide range of solutions,
from academic and administrative processes to general purpose software
libraries.

There are many ways to get involved in Project FénixEdu. This section describes
how to collaborate on this project.


#### Road-map Discussion

The projects core development team has a meeting to discuss the progress of
work currently under way and to update milestone predictions. Serious bugs and
urgent unpredicted features are put forward during these meetings.

About every six months the core development team will get together to discuss
major features and rewrites. It is during these discussions that new features
should be proposed. We usually don't publicise these meetings, however if you
wish to participate in these discussions either regarding the whole project or
a specific sub-project, let us know.   

Each sub-project has it's own road-map that is posted on the sub-projects' 
web-site.
