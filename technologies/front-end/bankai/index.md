### Bankai

Bankai is a consolidation of several Javascript libraries with the objective of easing the development of the user interface applications that communicate with REST-based API. Hence, if your application has a REST API, you can use Bankai to quickly develop a Javascript UI that communicates with that API. If you don't have a REST API, you can learn how to create one by following [this tutorial][Expose your web services with a REST API].
